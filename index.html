                                        <div class="">No doubt, you have to decide the kind and purpose of event you want to host on campus. Is it a tech meetup, a party, or a business seminar? You would then be able to carefully plan.</div><br>
                                        <span class="sub_head">2. Have a team</span>

                                        <div>The saying goes thus, ‘a tree does not make a forest’. Working with dedicated people eases stress and helps. It’s better when you think of how to do a thing with someone who believes in the goal. You may have to
                                            run errands that are demanding physically and financially. You may be to do publicity and alot of other stuff that might weigh you down, especially if you are a student. But then, you have to select team members
                                            based on your needs. Every person has to specifically handle a responsibility. A team could be two people or more. Make sure everyone comes to fill a space, meet a need. You could also partner with organizations
                                            on campus. In the earliest days of the Developer Student Clubs in KWASU, we partnered with the National Universities Engineering Students Association (NUESA). They help secure venues for the our weekly meetups.</div><br>

                                        <div>When you have a team for the event you have decided to organize, you should look at the University timetable for the available venues on the date you choose for the event. Also, check for the time periods when the
                                            venues would be available that day. You need to be sure a lecture, seminar, meeting, or another event is not taking place at the time you want to host your event. You could reach out to Student Affairs Unit
                                            for the University timetable.

                                        <div class="sub_head">4. Seek Approval to Host on campus</div>
                                        <div>You’d have to write an application to host host an event via email to the office of the Student Affairs. Another option is to walk into the office of the Student Affairs Unit and hand over a hard-copy of your application.
                                            If you are not a student or staff of the KWASU, you’d have to write the application via email to the Office of University Relations. Include in the mail, details of the chosen venue, date and time proposed.
                                            Also, don’t forget to describe the type and purpose of the event, the sponsors and organizers. Then await a reply. If you aren’t a student or staff of the University, you could reach out to the University Relations
                                            instead of the Student Affairs Unit. Upon approval, you may go on with putting the info out. Meanwhile, you should inform the Works and Security Department of the approved department. The Student Affairs Unit
                                            would of course guide you as appropriate.</div><br>

                                        <div>After securing approval of the Student Affairs Unit, put the word out. Let the information reach your intended audience. You can go by word of mouth from department to department or college to college. You may distribute
                                            handbills and notes at strategic points on campus. You should of course intensify efforts on social media, especially Instagram, Whatsapp and Facebook. You could involve student influencers, form PR guys to
                                            top artistes and student leaders in the respective departments.</div><br>

                                        <div>Before the event day comes, make sure you check at the event venue with the officials in charge of the particular venue. Be sure you’re booked already and they are aware of the details of the event. You could send
                                            the Works and Security department a reminder too.</div><br>
